Introduction
------------

The Wilson-Daubechies-Meyer (WDM) wavelet basis is widely used for gravitational wave (GW) data analysis.
While far from being the only available choice, the WDM basis wavelets have properties that make 
them particularly suitable for this purpose: they are well separated in frequency (in fact, they have
compact support) which helps connect with the rest of GW data analysis which is almost exclusively done 
in the frequency domain, and they provide uniform tiling in both time and frequency.
The WDM wavelets were first introduced to GW data analysis in Ref. [1]_ (see also Ref. [2]_) and are used 
in Coherent WaveBurst (CWB; Refs. [3]_ and [4]_).



Normalised Incomplete Beta Function
-----------------------------------

The WDM wavelets use the normalised incomplete beta function, :math:`\nu_d(x)`,

.. math::

   \nu_d(x) = \frac{ \int_0^x \mathrm{d}t \, t^{d-1} (1 - t)^{d-1} }
                         { \int_0^1 \mathrm{d}t \, t^{d-1} (1 - t)^{d-1} } ,
                         \quad \mathrm{for}\; 0\leq x\leq 1.

This acts as a smooth transition function (or compact sigmoid-like function) from 0 to 1.
The parameter :math:`d` controls the steepness of the transition; see :numref:`fig-norm_incomplete_beta`.

The function :math:`\nu_d(x)` is implemented in :func:`WDM.code.utils.Meyer.nu_d`.

   The normalised incomplete beta function :math:`\nu_d(x)` for several values of :math:`d`.



Meyer Window
------------

The WDM wavelet transform is based on the Meyer window function, which is 
defined in the frequency domain by

.. math::

    \tilde{\Phi}(\omega) = \begin{cases}
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Delta\Omega}} & \text{if } |\omega| < A, \\
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Delta\Omega}} \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\nu_d\left(\frac{|\omega| -
         A}{B}\right)\right) & \text{if } A \leq |\omega| \leq A + B \\
        0 & \text{if } |\omega| > A + B
    \end{cases} ,

where :math:`\omega=2\pi f`, and :math:`B` are two positive angular frequency parameters that control the shape of the window.
They satisfy :math:`2A + B = \Delta\Omega`, where :math:`\Delta\Omega` is the total wavelet bandwidth.
The parameter :math:`A` is the half-width of the flat-top response region while :math:`B` is the width of the transition region;
see :numref:`fig-Meyer_window`.
Unless otherwise stated, we use the default values :math:`A=\Delta \Omega/4`, :math:`B=\Delta \Omega/2`, and :math:`d=4`.

The function :math:`\tilde{\Phi}(\omega)` is implemented in :func:`WDM.code.utils.Meyer.Meyer`.

.. _fig-Meyer_window:

   The Meyer window function :math:`\tilde{\Phi}(\omega)` for different values of :math:`d`.
   The bottom panel shows the window in the time-domain, :math:`\phi(t)`, 
   where :math:`\Delta T = \pi/\Delta \Omega`. The case :math:`d=4` matches Fig.1 of Ref. [2]_.



WDM Wavelets
------------

This section relates to the example notebook `./examples/plotting_the_mother_wavelets.ipynb`.

Henceforth, we will work with frequency :math:`f` rather than angular frequency :math:`\omega=2\pi f`. 
This fits with the rest of the GW data analysis community which tends to work with frequency.

Consider a function of time :math:`x(t)`. 
The discretely sampled time series :math:`x[k]=x(t_k)` is indexed by :math:`k\in\{0, 1, \ldots, N-1\}` 
and evaluated at the sample times :math:`t_k=k\delta t`, where :math:`\delta t` is the cadence.
The total duration of the time series is :math:`T=N\delta t`, 
and the Nyquist frequency is :math:`f_{\rm Ny}=\frac{1}{2\delta t}`.
We will insist that :math:`N` is even.

The WDM wavelet transformation represents the time series using :math:`N_f` frequency slices of with :math:`\Delta F`
and :math:`N_t` time slices of width :math:`\Delta T`; 

.. math::

   \Delta T = N_f \delta t ,

.. math::

   \Delta F = \frac{1}{2 N_f \delta t} = \frac{N_t}{2T} .

There are :math:`N=N_t N_f` cells, each with area :math:`\Delta T \Delta F = \frac{1}{2}`.
Together, these tiles uniformly cover the timeâ€“frequency plane.
We will insist that :math:`N_t` and :math:`N_f` are both even.

The WDM wavelets :math:`g_{nm}(t)` are constructed from the Meyer window function :math:`\phi`. 
In the frequency-domain they are defined as

.. math::

    \tilde{G}_{nm}(f) = \begin{cases}
        \exp(-4\pi i n f \Delta T) \tilde{\Phi}(2\pi f) & m=0 \\
        \exp(-2\pi i n f \Delta T) \left( C_{nm}\tilde{\Phi}(2\pi [f-m\Delta F])
        +C^*_{nm}\tilde{\Phi}(2\pi [f+m\Delta F]) \right) & 0<m<N_f \\
        \exp(-4\pi i n f \Delta T) \left( \tilde{\Phi}(2\pi [f+N_f\Delta F]) + 
        \tilde{\Phi}(2\pi [f-N_f\Delta F]) \right) & m=N_f \\
    \end{cases} ,

where the coefficients :math:`C_{nm}` are defined to be 1 is if :math:`n+m` is even, and :math:`i` if :math:`n+m` is odd.

The WDM wavelets are plotted in the frequency domain in :numref:`fig-WDM_wavelets_FD`.

.. _fig-WDM_wavelets_FD:

.. figure:: ../figures/Gnm_spectra.png
   :alt: Gnm_spectra
   :align: center
   :width: 70%

   The :math:`d=4` WDM wavelets :math:`|\tilde{G}_{nm}(\omega)|` plotted in the frequency domain for 
   :math:`m=0, 1, 2,\ldots,N_f`. 
   Wavelets computed using :math:`N_f=16` are shown to match Fig.2 of Ref. [1]_.

As defined, the index :math:`m` takes on both values 0 and :math:`N_f`.
However, these two cases can be conveniently grouped together.
Because of the :math:`2\Delta T` time shift, only half of the :math:`n` range is needed;
therefore, we redefine :math:`G_{n0}(f):=G_{nN_f}(f)` when :math:`n>N_t/2`.
With this choice, the index ranges :math:`n\in\{0,1,\ldots,N_t-1\}` and :math:`m\in\{0,1,\ldots,N_f-1\}`
cover the entire time-frequency plane; see :numref:`fig-WDM_wavelets_animate`.
The central time and frequency of the wavelet :math:`g_{nm}(t)` are given by

.. math::

   t_{nm} = \begin{cases} ( 2n \,\mathrm{mod} \, N_t ) \Delta T & \mathrm{if}\;m=0 \\
                     n \Delta T & \mathrm{if}\;m>0 \end{cases} \,,

.. math::

   f_{nm} = \begin{cases} \begin{cases}0&\mathrm{if}\;n<N_t/2\\
                           f_{\rm Ny}&\mathrm{if}\,n\geq N_t/2\end{cases} & \mathrm{if}\;m=0 \\
                     m \Delta F & \mathrm{if}\;m>0 \end{cases} \,.

Examples of the WDM wavelets with :math:`N=512`, :math:`N_f=16`, and :math:`\delta t=1`
are shown in :numref:`fig-WDM_wavelets_TD`, :numref:`fig-WDM_wavelets_TF`, and :numref:`fig-WDM_wavelets_animate`.
Notice that the WDM wavelets are well localised in frequency but much less so in time.

   Notice in particular the behaviour of the wavelets for :math:`m=0`.

The WDM wavelets have the following orthonomality property,

.. math::

   2 \pi \delta t \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} g_{nm}[k] g_{n'm'}[k] = \delta_{nn'} \delta_{mm'} .

The frequency-domain WDM wavelets :math:`\tilde{G}_{nm}(f)` are implemented in 
:func:`WDM.code.discrete_wavelet_transform.WDM.WDM_transform.Gnm`.

The time-domain WDM wavelets :math:`g_{nm}(t)` are implemented in 
:func:`WDM.code.discrete_wavelet_transform.WDM.WDM_transform.gnm`.



The Discrete WDM Wavelet Transform
----------------------------------

This section relates to the example notebook `./examples/motivating_the_discrete_wavelet_transform.ipynb`.

This section defines the discrete WDM wavelet transform, present its exact formulation, and describe a 
computationally efficient implementation suitable for practical use.

The WDM wavelets form a complete orthonormal basis for discretely sampled time series,

.. math::

   x[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N_t-1} \sum_{m=0}^{N_f-1} w_{nm} g_{nm}[k] .

Here, :math:`x[k]` is the input time series, :math:`w_{nm}` are the wavelet coefficients, and :math:`g_{nm}[k]` are the 
WDM wavelet basis function.

An expression for the wavelet coefficients :math:`w_{nm}` can be derived by multiplying both sides of this
equation by :math:`g_{n'm'}[k]`, summing over :math:`k`, and using the orthonormality property to obtain

.. math::

   w_{nm} = 2\pi \delta t\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} x[k] g_{nm}[k] .

This is the exact expression for the forward wavelet transform which transforms from the time 
to the time-frequency domain. 

This *exact* wavelet transform is implemented in
:func:`WDM.code.discrete_wavelet_transform.WDM.WDM_transform.forward_transform_exact`.

The exact form of the wavelet transform described above is slow to implement.
A practical improvement arises from the observation that the WDM are (approximately) localised in time
and the sum over :math:`k` can be truncated to a window of length :math:`K=2qN_f` without significant loss of accuracy.
The truncation parameter :math:`1\leq q\leq N_t/2` is a positive integer that controls the length of the window.
The truncated wavelet transform is given by

.. math::

   w_{n0} = 2\pi\delta t\sum_{k=-K/2}^{K/2-1} 
                                    g_{nm}[k + 2 n N_f] x[k + 2 n N_f] ,

.. math::

   w_{nm} = 2\pi\delta t\sum_{k=-K/2}^{K/2-1} 
                                    g_{nm}[k + n N_f] x[k + n N_f] 
                                    \quad \mathrm{for} \; m>0.  

This form of the *truncated* wavelet transform is implemented in
:func:`WDM.code.discrete_wavelet_transform.WDM.WDM_transform.forward_transform_truncated`.

Smaller values of :math:`q` yield faster but less accurate results, see :numref:`fig-trunc_err`.

.. _fig-trunc_err:

.. figure:: ../figures/trunc_err.png
   :alt: trunc_err
   :align: center
   :width: 70%

   The error in the truncated wavelet transform as a function of :math:`q`.
   The wavelet transform is applied to a white-noise time series with :math:`\mathrm{rms}=1`.
   The error is defined as the maximum relative absolute difference between the original signal and 
   that reconstructed signals from the truncated wavelet transform. 
   For :math:`q=N_t/2=16`, there is no truncation and the result agrees with the exact transform.

The truncated wavelet transform can be rewritten in terms of the window function :math:`\phi[k]`

.. code-block:: python

   f = jnp.fft.fftfreq(N, d=dt) 
   Phi = Meyer(2.*jnp.pi*f, d, A, B)
   phi = jnp.fft.ifft(Phi).real

This window is created using
:func:`WDM.code.discrete_wavelet_transform.WDM.WDM_transform.build_time_domain_window`.

Using the definition of the WDM wavelets, the truncated wavelet transform can be written as

.. math::

   w_{nm} = 2\sqrt{2}\pi\delta t \mathrm{Re} \sum_{k=-K/2}^{K/2-1} 
                            C_{nm} \exp(i\pi km/N_f) 
                            x[k+nN_f] \phi[k] \quad \mathrm{for}\; m>0,

.. math::

   w_{n0} = 2\pi\delta t\sum_{k=-K/2}^{K/2-1} 
                            x[k+2nN_f] \phi[k] \quad \mathrm{for}\; n<N_t/2,

.. math::

   w_{n0} = 2\pi\delta t\sum_{k=-K/2}^{K/2-1} (-1)^k x[k+2nN_f]
                            \phi[k] \quad \mathrm{for}\; n\geq N_t/2.

This form of the *truncted, window* wavelet transform using :math:`\phi[k]` is implemented in
:func:`WDM.code.discrete_wavelet_transform.WDM.WDM_transform.forward_transform_window`.

The greatest computational speed up comes from writing the truncated wavelet transform in terms of the
the windowed Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
The windowed FFT is defined as

.. math::

   X_n[j] = \sum_{k=-K/2}^{K/2-1} \exp(2\pi i kj/K) x[nN_f+k] \phi[k] ,

where the index :math:`j` runs over a range :math:`K`.

The *windowed FFT* (with these index and sign conventions) is implemented in
:func:`WDM.code.discrete_wavelet_transform.WDM.WDM_transform.windowed_fft`

Using the windowed FFT, the truncated wavelet transform can be written as

.. math::

   w_{nm} = 2\pi \sqrt{2} \delta t \mathrm{Re} C_{nm} X_n[mq] , \quad \mathrm{for} \; m>0.

I.e., the wavelet transform can be computed using the windowed FFT of the time series downsampled to 
every :math:`q^{\rm th}` coefficient.

This expression only holds for :math:`m>0`.
If the :math:`m=0` terms are required, they can be computed using the above truncted-window wavelet transform expressions.
However, in many applications the :math:`m=0` terms are not needed anyway.

This *windowed FFT* form of the truncted wavelet transform is implemented in
:func:`WDM.code.discrete_wavelet_transform.WDM.WDM_transform.forward_transform_truncated_windowed_fft`.
If the :math:`m=0` terms are required, pass the argument ``m0=True`` to this function.

This windowed FFT form of the truncated wavelet transform is much more efficient.
However, a small further improvement is possible by using the fact that the WDM wavelets 
are more compact in the frequency domain than in the time domain.
It is slightly faster to compute the transform using the FFT of the full original time series.
